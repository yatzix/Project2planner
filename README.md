> For this project we have built from scratch a Full-Stack Node/Express/MongoDB web application. This is an user friendly application that allows the users to log in to their accounts through Google's OAuth Service. Once logged in, the user will be able to create goals and give them a status, keep track of the progress through a journal entry feature, and add the necessary to-dos in order to achieve their goals. As a full CRUD application, users will also have the opportunity to delete goals and to-dos.

## Roadmap
✅ AAU I want to be able to login into my user profile.
✅ AAU I want to have the option to delete to-dos from to-dos list in my Goals Details page
✅ AAU I want to be able to create goals into my user profile.
✅ AAU I want to be able to add journal entries to each goal created.

## Ice Box
🔧 AAU I want to be able to change the satus of my goals and the goals' to-dos. If a goal is completed, have it stored in a "Completed Goals" section.
🔧 AAU I want to receive motivational messages every time I log in.
