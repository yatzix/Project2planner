> For this project we have built from scratch a Full-Stack Node/Express/MongoDB web application. This is an user friendly application that allows the users to log in to their accounts through Google's OAuth Service. Once logged in, the user will be able to create goals and give them a status, keep track of the progress through a journal entry feature, and add the necessary to-dos in order to achieve their goals. As a full CRUD application, users will also have the opportunity to delete goals and to-dos.
